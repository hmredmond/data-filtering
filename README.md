# StatsBomb Interview Test

In this coding test, you're going to create a simple front-end
application to load and display some football data.

## Data

A selection of statistical data has been pre made for you to use in
your application in the following files:

* `player-data.json`
* `match-data.json`
* `stat-data.json`
* `team-data.json`

You can load this data in your app however you like, either wrapping
it in an API or just pasting it into your source code.

## Web app

Your next task is to create a single page web application. This can be
done in any dialect of scripting language plus whatever libraries you
think are appropriate. The application needs the following features:

* It should display some sort of visualisation of the data above,
  e.g. a chart or graph etc.
* You should include some sort of interactive filtering or selection
  of data that updates the viz in realtime.
* It should persist the user's last filters and selections across
  browser sessions.

## Deliverables

When you're done, zip up your code, and email it along with
instructions on how to run it to careers@statsbomb.com. We'll look at
what you've done and arrange some time for you to walk us through your
code, and we'll ask some follow up questions about your work and how
you might build on it.

We are much more interested in the quality and clarity of your code
than how much functionality you deliver. Don't panic if you run out of
time, we just want to see how you approach real problems with real
code.


## Instructions

Please run the following commands in order to load tha application:

### 1. To install the dependencies:

```yarn```

### 2. To run the api server:

```yarn start:server```

### 3. To load the web application

```yarn start```
